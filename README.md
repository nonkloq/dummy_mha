# DASS42 Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing DASS42 data and constructing predictive decision tree models to predict DASS levels using only a few questions. 

It's a dummy mental health analysis app, possibly created for an assignment or similar purpose (i forgor). The file dass42_analysis.ipynb includes plots and the construction of decision tree models, and app.py is a simple Flask web app to use these models.
